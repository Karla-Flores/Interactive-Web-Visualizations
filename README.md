<h1> Interactive-Web-Visualizations--Challenge </h1>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align = 'justify'>In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels in JSON format.</p>

<p align = 'justify'>The dataset reveals a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study). Demographics information is dynamically populated based upon a user-selected test subject ID. </p>

<p align = 'justify'>A bar chart, bubble chart, and a bonus gauge chart further update once the ID is changed. This code has been written using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.</p>

<p align = 'justify'>All CSS, JS, and images required are under the static folder. The main HTML file index.html is in the root folder of the Github repo. The dashboard can be viewed here: Belly Button Diversity Dashboard.</p>
